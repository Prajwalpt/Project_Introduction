<hr>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>I love the avengers. Pure Nostalgia for MCU lovers.<b>"We Will Whatever it Takes"</b></p>

<h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
<p>Again, the top movie from Russo Brothers. Cap vs Iron Man is damn GOOD to watch! <b>"I Can Do this All DAY"</b>

<h3>Daredevil</h3>
<p>Not a movie. But there has to be a movie on this superhero, or rather I say... A Blind Human.<b>"I am Daredevil"</b>
